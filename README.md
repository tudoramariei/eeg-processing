# eeg-processing
The code from my Master's thesis.

The code takes in csv data collected through the iMotions EEG headset and the 
[Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/) 
application and generates graphs showing the brain activity in the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta frequency bands.

## Running the code

1. Install the requirements
```shell
pip install requirements.txt
```

2. Run the code
```shell
python3 graph_eeg.py
```
